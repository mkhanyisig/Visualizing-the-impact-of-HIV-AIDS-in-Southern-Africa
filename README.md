Data source : http://dataportal.opendataforafrica.org/qbavydc/united-nations-aids-data-2016

For this class the main role was to create a Graphical User interface for data analysis and visualization. As the 
class developed, new analytical tools were added onto the GUI and were used for analysis like KNN classification, PCA analysis 
and more tools to help mine data and discover patterns/trends. For this ?project, the objective goal will be using the GUI data 
analysis and visualization tools to help me answer a research question(s) the data set I choose, for my given case study.  

Like most countries, Swaziland has a very complex history with challenges of all sorts, and this history tends to translate 
in the complexity in people's lives as well. A quick web  search of Swaziland would probably tell you that it has a high HIV 
infection rate, high mortality rate, low life expectancy, high levels of poverty and the list goes on. Whilst this might be 
true, such general statements do not give a full picture of the situation or even highlight any indication of changes in those 
statistics or improvements, the resilience of the people and the continual dedication made by community members to fight off 
the many challenges developing communities face.  Of the many problems Swaziland has faced, by far one of the biggest 
challenges the country has come a long way dealing with, is the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic which has devastated 
communities over the years, through taking many lives of members in our communities. At some point in 2009, the HIV 
infection rate in the country was at a staggering 45% for the adult population of Swaziland, coupled with a 32 year 
life expectancy at the time. This disease which has been affecting many developing communities in the past three decades 
has been a real cause of concern, and much has been done over the years, to avert the harmful impacts it has had. The HIV-AIDS
 epidemic is not one that has affected Swaziland only, but it has devastated the entire Southern African developing community
too, and it still continues to. 

Analysing statistical  improvements in the HIV-epidemic for Swaziland and the Southern African community as a whole is something 
I have an interest in, to understand the improvements made, and beginning this project. it was my hope to get useful data that 
could help me achieve that. From the UN-AIDS "open data for Africa" website, I found a data bank source that had most of the 
relevant statistics I needed, in order to understand the changing statistics of the different parameters HIV-AIDS has had on 
Southern African communities. From the statistical analysis with my GUI, my aim is to see whether have there been improvements 
or not, in the statistical indicators for the countries I am looking into. 

Research Questions

1. Given the HIV-AIDS epidemic, how have the results changing been over the years, do they show a improvement or not?

2. For new infections, people living with HIV-AIDS, and AIDS related deaths, which countries have had the most success in reducing these impacts of the deadly disease within their communities. 

Method of analysis

Using the UN-AIDS open data for Africa website, I was hoping to obtain csv data files from the website, which would allow 
my analysis to be much sipmler. However, that was not the case, but I got something close, as it automatically generated excel 
files for the data you request. The data source gave the values of each parameter against the year for each coutnry. Working 
with that, editing my excel files, each variable parameter I made it a numeric column, and for each country, I used country 
numeric codes instead, so these could be easily viewed & distinguished on the color axis.

Conclusion

The GUI developed in this course has proved very helpful in helping me analyze and understand information about my data, 
through visualization. Having started off with assumptions, my data HIV-AIDS for my selected communities helped me 
understand the relations between different countries in their battles with the HIV-AIDS epidemic. 

What I learnt
 
Through data analysis and visualization, I was able to gain insight on the HIV-AIDS situation, and the data visualization helped 
me undestand the trends and progresses in the fight towards combatting the impacts of HIV. 
 
Most of my time was spent editing my data files than the actual analysis, and if I could have, writing a program to read in 
the downloaded data files, and convert them to the csv format the display.py file reads, that would have been a very useful 
application of my knowledge gained in this class, through developing algorithms to process large data sets.
